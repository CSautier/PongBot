This code is a dqn implementation of a bot playing Atari Pong from game images.
The net is written for Tensorflow's implementation of Keras.

It uses some clever speedups such as a "quickstart" to train the model much faster in the beginning.

A good way to start the training would be to run main(mode=1, quickstart=True, steps_quickstart=500).
